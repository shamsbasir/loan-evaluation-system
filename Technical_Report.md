2. **Data Generation Pipeline**: Creates balanced training datasets with realistic loan applications
3. **Model Training Infrastructure**: Fine-tunes LLaMA 3.2-1B model for loan evaluation
4. **Configuration Management**: Centralized system for managing training parameters and paths

### 1.2 Technology Stack

- **Base Model**: LLaMA 3.2-1B-Instruct (Unsloth optimization)
- **Framework**: PyTorch with Transformers library
- **Data Processing**: Pandas, JSON processing
- **Training Infrastructure**: Custom PyTorch DataLoader with conversation-based training

## 2. Business Logic Implementation

### 2.1 Loan Evaluation Rules

The system implements the following decision criteria:

| Criterion            | Threshold                     | Action               |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Age                  | ≥ 18 years                    | REJECT if below      |
| Credit Score         | ≥ 670                         | REJECT if below      |
| Annual Income        | ≥ $30,000                     | REJECT if below      |
| Debt-to-Income Ratio | ≤ 40%                         | REJECT if above      |
| Employment Status    | Valid employment types\*      | REJECT if invalid    |
| Employment Duration  | ≥ 6 months                    | FLAG_REVIEW if below |
| Residency Status     | US Citizen/Permanent Resident | REJECT if other      |
| Recent Bankruptcy    | No recent bankruptcy          | REJECT if yes        |
| Loan-to-Income Ratio | ≤ 50% of annual income        | FLAG_REVIEW if above |
| Bank Account         | Verifiable account required   | REJECT if none       |

\*Valid employment types: employed_full_time, employed_part_time, self_employed, retired

### 2.2 Decision Categories

The system produces three possible outcomes:

- **APPROVE**: All criteria met, loan approved
- **REJECT**: One or more hard criteria failed
- **FLAG_REVIEW**: Soft criteria violated, requires human review

## 3. Data Generation Strategy

### 3.1 Balanced Dataset Creation

The data generation pipeline creates a balanced dataset with equal representation across all decision categories:

```
Total Samples: 15,000
├── Training Set: 12,000 (80%)
│   ├── APPROVE: 4,004 (33.4%)
│   ├── REJECT: 4,019 (33.5%)
│   └── FLAG_REVIEW: 3,977 (33.1%)
├── Validation Set: 1,500 (10%)
└── Test Set: 1,500 (10%)
```

### 3.2 Biased Generation Approach

The system employs intelligent data generation with 80% biased generation toward target outcomes and 20% random generation to ensure:

- **Realistic Data Distribution**: Applications reflect real-world scenarios
- **Class Balance**: Equal representation prevents model bias
- **Edge Case Coverage**: Boundary conditions are adequately represented

### 3.3 Data Quality Metrics

- **Generation Efficiency**: ~70-80% success rate for target class generation
- **Feature Diversity**: Wide range of applicant profiles
- **Rule Coverage**: All business rules tested across samples

## 4. Model Architecture and Training

### 4.1 Base Model Selection

**LLaMA 3.2-1B-Instruct** was chosen for the following reasons:

- **Efficiency**: 1B parameters provide good performance-to-resource ratio
- **Instruction Following**: Pre-trained for following structured prompts
- **Memory Requirements**: Manageable for fine-tuning infrastructure
- **JSON Generation**: Capable of structured output generation

### 4.2 Training Configuration

```python
TRAINING_PARAMETERS = {
    "batch_size": 4,
    "learning_rate": 5e-5,
    "epochs": 3,
    "max_sequence_length": 1024,
    "gradient_accumulation_steps": 1,
    "warmup_steps": 100,
    "weight_decay": 0.01,
    "max_grad_norm": 1.0
}
```

### 4.3 Training Approach

The system uses **conversation-based fine-tuning** where:

1. **System Prompt**: Contains complete rule specification
2. **User Input**: JSON-formatted loan application
3. **Assistant Output**: JSON response with decision and reasoning

### 4.4 Loss Function and Optimization

- **Causal Language Modeling Loss**: Standard next-token prediction
- **Label Masking**: Only assistant responses contribute to loss
- **Optimizer**: AdamW with gradient clipping for stability

## 5. Data Processing Pipeline

### 5.1 Conversation Dataset Structure

Each training sample follows the conversation format:

```json
{
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "system",
      "content": "You are a loan evaluator following these rules..."
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "{\"age\": 25, \"credit_score\": 750, ...}"
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "{\"result\": \"APPROVE\", \"reasoning\": \"...\"}"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 5.2 Tokenization Strategy

- **Padding Side**: Left padding for causal language modeling
- **Sequence Length**: 1024 tokens maximum
- **Special Tokens**: EOS token handling for completion detection
- **Attention Masking**: Proper masking for variable-length sequences

### 5.3 Custom DataLoader Implementation

The system implements specialized data handling:

- **Dynamic Batching**: Variable sequence length support
- **Memory Efficiency**: Optimized padding and masking
- **Picklable Collate Function**: Multiprocessing compatibility
